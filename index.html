        <p> Photography can be taken literally and not so literally. Literally speaking, photography is a document, now used more often to state, "I am here," "I exist," "Be apart of my life," "know who I am." And if you don't know how to take a picture, it's considered unusual. Not so literally speaking, photography is a magical box, which captures light and you can do whatever you please with your captured light.

            
            When I hold my camera to my face and look through the glass to see my subject gazing back at me, the world around me goes silent, and from the moment I start my set of images, to the moment I've finished editing them, I feel free. I've created something. I've grown as an artist. And that is my accomplishment.
            
            
            For the future - I hope I will have managed to make, support or assist in the changes we are desperate to see.  I hope the success can be measured over years and decades to come….  I hope in 10 years we still have the animals that are so critically endanger.

            
            For the now - I love the restless race of your heart as a journey begins, I love a wild and unusual idea, I love champagne and chilies, I Love the perfect play list and I love to watch the bush change with every minute of light.
